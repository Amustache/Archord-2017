# Archord-2017 - Architecture des ordinateurs/Computer architecture (EPFL, 2017)
_This repo is for information purpose only. Try to do the homeworks by yourself before anything else._

Coursebook: http://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/computer-architecture-CS-208

From the coursebook: _The course introduces the students to the basic notions of computer architecture and, in particular, to the choices of the Instruction Set Architecture and to the memory hierarchy of modern systems._

## lab00: VHDL Testbench Design (Tutorial)
_This  tutorial  introduces  readers  to  the  craft  of  writing  simple  VHDL  testbenches.   We  start  with  an empty VHDL testbench file and iteratively explain our thought process and how it affects the way we construct  the  testbench.   We  start  with  a  simple  testbench  for  a  combinatorial  circuit,  then  move  on towards a more complicated testbench for a sequential circuit._

## lab01: Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU)
_In this lab you will implement a complete Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU) and practice writing and using testbenches, as well as making gate-level simulations._

## lab02: Register File and Memories (RAM, ROM)
_In this lab, you will learn how to implement memories in VHDL and how to instantiate FPGA memory components. The components you build here will be re-used in the project of designing a system with a full processor. You will implement 3 different memories: a Register File, a ROM, and a RAM._

## lab03: Designing a Multicycle Processor
_In this lab you will implement a multicycle Nios II processor. You will implement it step-by-stepâ€”beginning with a CPU that executes a few basic instructions and extending it progressively to cover all the requested functionalities of the Nios II. You will also use some of the components you built in the previous sessions._

## lab04: A Pong Game in Assembly Language
_During this lab,  you will implement a simplified version of the well-known Pong game in assembly language. At the end of the lab, you should be able to play the game on the Gecko4EPFL._
